Two possible setups : 

 1. Raspberry Pi OS + Python + Home assistant integration
Pros
- Full and easy access to I2C GPIO
- Easy control of sensors and webcams
- Home Assist. Integration provides necessary tools
- Allows for automation customization

Cons
  - Requires more setup than flashing Home Assistant OS


 2. Home Assistant OS (Flashed directly)
Pros
- Simplified automation environment
- Built in widgets and config settings

Cons
- Harder to run scripts, customize automation
- Limited access and configuration with GPIO and I2C
- Not suitable for sensor control

Chosen Solution:
I chose **Raspberry Pi OS + Python + Home Assistant Integration** because it offers full hardware control while still making notifications, webcame automation and everything work great.
